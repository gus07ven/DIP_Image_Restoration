To run filters for testing do this:
1. Go to Filtering.py
2. Go to bottom of the file
3. See notes and change what you need to change
4. When running the program. It will show the histogram of the result first
(close it to proceed), then it will show you the image with noise (press any key),
then it will show you the restored image after applying the filter (press any key to end program).
